This is the project that my teammates and I did in the MAST30034 - Applied Data Science
course at the University of Melbourne. In this project, our primary data was collected
from Domain.com - an Australian real estate website. We used several models (Linear Regression
and Random Forest) to predict the current rental prices and also give the predictions
for the rental prices in the next 3 years. After that, we formed a
metric to rank Victorian suburbs based on their livability and affordability.
